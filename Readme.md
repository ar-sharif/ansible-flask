# Application Deployment on differenet insatnces

This is a hands-on project I built to practice using Ansible, Vagrant, and Flask together. Flask handles the application layer, and I wrote some Ansible playbooks to apply config changes across multiple VMs. I’m using Vagrant to spin up the VMs — they run Debian, and I set up Python and OpenSSH on them right from the start. Feel free to tweak or customize anything based on your own use case.
